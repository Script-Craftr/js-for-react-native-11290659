# Task 1
I implemented a function which takes an array of numbers as argument. The function returns a new array where even numbers are squared and odd numbers are tripled..

# Task 2
I implemented a second function in the same file as Task 1 which accepts two arrays as arguments, one of type string and the other, the new array returned from the first function. This second function capitalizes the string if its corresponding number is even and converts the string to lowercase if otherwise.

# Task 3
I implemented a function in a separate file.This function takes an array of names and the returned modified string array from Task 2.Then it returns an array of objects, each having 'originalName', 'modifiedName', and 'id' keys.
